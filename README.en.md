# LINE Simple Beacon
LINE Simple Beacon is a specification for beacon hardware for LINE bot developers. LINE Simple Beacon is based on the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) specification and lets developers use the [LINE Beacon](https://devdocs.line.me/en/#line-beacon) service on regular devices.

## Security limitations
LINE Simple Beacon does not have a mechanism for preventing devices from being impersonated. Therefore, do not use bot services which automatically assumes that a beacon's ID is valid.

## Prerequisites
The following are required to use LINE Simple Beacon for developing a beacon that is integrated with a LINE bot.

* Have more than one bot account
* Have a device that can control a BLE controller

## Specification details
LINE Simple Beacon is made up of the following elements

* BLE Controller
* Bluetooth Host
* LINE Simple Beacon frame

The following are the specifications for each element.

### BLE Controller
The BLE Controller is a wireless device based on the BLE specification.

Beacons must have a module installed that conforms to the BLE Controller specifications as required by Bluetooth.
The recommended Bluetooth version is 4.0. Although a BLE controller which supports Bluetooth versions higher than 4.0 can be used, note that the LINE application may not detect the beacon if a feature not defined in Bluetooth 4.0 is configured with LINE Simple Beacon.

### Bluetooth Host
Bluetooth Host is a program that controls the BLE Controller based on Bluetooth protocols and profiles.

With LINE Simple Beacon, to ensure that the LINE app can quickly detect devices, control the BLE Controller according to the Broadcaster Role (BLUETOOTH SPECIFICATION Version 4.0 [Vol 3], Part C Section 2.2.2.1) as defined by Generic Access Profile.

#### Advertising data
Bluetooth Host consists of the following advertising data which must be passed to the BLE Controller.

* AD Type: Flags
  * Value: Cannot have a value of `0x00`. Set an appropriate value based on the characteristics of the device.
* AD Type: Service UUIDs
  * 16bit Service UUID: `0xFE6F`. UUID to provide the Bluetooth service through LINE.
* AD Type: Service Data
  * 16bit Service UUID: `0xFE6F`. Supports service UUIDs.
  * Service Data: LINE Simple Beacon Frame

#### Advertising data example
For devices with the characteristics shown below, advertising data is displayed when the following parameters are used.

* Characteristics
  * Packets are transmitted regularly
  * Only supports BLE（does not support BR/EDR）
* Parameter example 1
  * HWID: `32AF519E88`
  * Device Message: `0032006900FAFFFF000199FF88`
* Parameter example 2
  * HWID: `8ADFAF4326`
  * Device Message: `20170228`

The following table shows the advertising data using parameter example 1 and example 2. Set the value as `0x00` for byte offsets greater than 22 for parameter example 2 as values greater than 22 becomes the non-significant part (BLUETOOTH SPECIFICATION Version 4.0 [Vol 3], Part C Section 11).

Byte<br/> Offset | Example 1<br/> Value |Example 2<br/> Value | Description 
--:|:------:|:------:|------------|

### LINE Simple Beacon Frame

LINE Simple Beacon Frame is the variable-length data which contains the information to identify devices. The binary length is 8–20 bytes. Big-endian is the byte order used for multi-byte data. The following information is stored in order. These are all the required items.

| Property         | Data type    | Size     | Description                              |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Frame Type       | Fixed Length | 1 byte    | Only ``0x02`` can be used                |
| HWID             | Fixed Length | 5 bytes   | ID of beacon device<br>Set an HWID for each device. Do not use HWIDs other than the HWIDs issued for your own bot account.<br>HWIDs are issued through the [LINE Official Account Manager](https://admin-official.line.me/beacon/register). |
| Measured TxPower | Fixed Length | 1 byte    | Only ``0x7F`` can be used                           |
| Device Message   | Variable Length | 1–13 bytes | Can be used freely by developers. When the LINE application detects a beacon, the HWID and other properties are passed to the LINE server.<br>Set value as `0x00` if the "Device Message" property is not used. No event will be sent if no value is set. |

"Device Message" is notified to your bot account via LINE server with the Messaging API. Use this to receive information from the beacon such as temperature, air pressure, and battery remaining.
